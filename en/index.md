# ALERT: This website is under construction. Planned end date: 2019-11-07

# Who am I?

I am a mathematician, I am a maker, I am a mother, I am vegetarian, I am Polish, I am Peruvian, I am French and again I am a mathematician. 

# What is this website?

I used to be a blogger. After a few years break from blogging, this website is yet another fresh start for my blogger identity. As usual, I'll blog mostly about mathematics. 

This website is also a placeholder for useful bits of information 

- about me: a CV, a list of publications, a list of projects...
- about my interests: a reading list, appreciation lists...

# How to use this website ? 

This is a multi-lingual website. Each page and post have at least a Spanish and a French version. Please click on the corresponding link to switch between languages.

I place high-value on the web accessibility. If you encounter any accessibility issues with this website, please tell me.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. This means that all the code is public, and that you can submit issues and pull-requests when you encounter any problem. Please, feel free to do so.
