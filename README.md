I used to be a blogger. After a few years break from blogging, this website is yet another fresh start for my blogger identity. As usual, I'll blog mostly about mathematics. 

This website is also a placeholder for useful bits of information 

- about me: a CV, a list of publications, a list of projects...
- about my interests: a reading list, appreciation lists...

This is a multi-lingual website: French, Spanish, Polish and English. Yeah, I know, that is a lot of languages - I'll make sure that all the pages have the four language versions, but blog posts will be probably posted only in two languages in average. If you click on, let say, the Polish language icon on a post and this post does not exist in Polish, you will be redirected to the list of all blog posts available in Polish.

I place high-value on the web accessibility. If you encounter any accessibility issues with this website, please tell me.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. This means that all the code is public, and that you can submit issues and pull-requests when you encounter any problem. Please, feel free to do so.
